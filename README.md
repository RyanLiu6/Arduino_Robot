    # Arduino_Robot
Arduino based Robot
Uses Code from previous projectfor ELEC 291 - UBC
- For testing purposes, I will only be using the original code
- After extensively testing the Ultrasonic sensors and possibly new IR sensors,
I will start with fresh

Goals:

1. Autonomous robot that does not need any input to move
2. Does not bump into any walls
3. Moves around the room "smartly"
⋅⋅1. Current thoughts: Move through a room once using object detection
⋅⋅2. Want to also save an image of the ceiling for each room and after one run,
    and will be able to differentiate between rooms and apply previous movements
⋅⋅3. Be able to recognize where is a cliff, and stop before falling off
4. Control the robot via Bluetooth using my Android Phone

The project is very similar to a Roomba, as it does most of those things. I have always
been interested in robotics and would love to apply the knowledge I learnt about embedded
software systems into my own projects. This is simply my own personal project.

Plan:
- Start to test new sensors during the month of October
- Create new code from scratch that does not use test code from previous project
- Aim to finish basic movement in straight lines and turns by the end of November
    - Aim to look into turning efficiently with the right angle with improved Ultrasonic and IR sensors
- Aim to start cliff hanging by mid December
- Aim to start Android application by mid December after cliff recognition
- Aim to develop algorithm for mapping rooms with MATLAB / Octave by the Feburary (2017)

This plan is not a strict plan per se, but rather a guideline for me to remind myself of
my project in my busy school days.
